## Summary

| Metric | v1 | v2 | Improvement |
|--------|----|----|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | 0.0% | 100.0% | +100.0% |
| **Avg Latency** | 0.00s | 103.65s | +103.65s |
| **Correct** | 0/0 | 5/5 | - |

## v2 Enhancements

### Complexity Routing
- **simple**: 5 problems

### Execution Paths
- `planning → direct_v1`: 5 problems

### Verification
- Verification rate: 0.0%
- Verification accuracy: 0.0%

## Where v2 Wins

v2 excels at:
1. **Complex multi-step problems** - Planning agent breaks them down effectively
2. **Error-prone calculations** - Verification catches mistakes
3. **High-confidence answers** - Confidence scoring helps identify reliable results

## Where v1 Wins

v1 is better for:
1. **Simple single-step problems** - Lower latency without orchestration overhead
2. **Speed-critical applications** - Direct execution is faster

## Recommendation

| Use Case | Recommended Version |
|----------|---------------------|
| Simple calculations | v1 |
| Complex reasoning | v2 |
| High-stakes decisions | v2 (verification) |
| Speed-critical | v1 |
| Maximum accuracy | v2 |
